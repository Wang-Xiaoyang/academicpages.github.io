A part local contrast measure algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of low efficiency of the original local contrast measure, which combines region saliency with original local contrast measure. Instead of finding the target in the whole image, the local contrast measure is constrained in the saliency region of the current image frame in the proposed method. At the first stage, the image entropy and local similarity feature are used to evaluate the saliency of infrared images, which measures the saliency region of a single frame. At the second stage, the local contrast measure is presented in the saliency region, which forms the part local contrast map. An adaptive threshold is adapted to segment the target from the part local contrast map. Experiments on several real infrared image sequences have validated the ability of the proposed method in improving the signal-to-noise ratio and the detection capability. In particular, the proposed method can reduce false alarm rate, which is an inherent defect of the original local contrast method. The high efficiency is also an important strength of the proposed method, which leads to a wide application prospect.
