## Infrared Small Target Detection
This project focuses on a traditional but challenging problem, the detection of infrared small targets. The small and dim nature of such kind of targets makes it difficult to design robust detection approaches, not to mention the diversity of scenarios. We proposed several methods to tackle this problem, including subspace learning-based method, total variation regularization method, visual saliency-based method, etc. The results have been published in IEEE Trans. Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, Image and Vision Computing, etc.
