2021-03-05	Self-play Learning Strategies for Resource Assignment in Open-RAN Networks	arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.02649			Paper-title-number-6	https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02649.pdf		Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) is being developed with an aim to democratise access and lower the cost of future mobile data networks, supporting network services with various QoS requirements, such as massive IoT and URLLC. In ORAN, network functionality is dis-aggregated into remote units (RUs), distributed units (DUs) and central units (CUs), which allows flexible software on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) deployments. Furthermore, the mapping of variable RU requirements to local mobile edge computing centres for future centralized processing would significantly reduce the power consumption in cellular networks. In this paper, we study the RU-DU resource assignment problem in an ORAN system, modelled as a 2D bin packing problem. A deep reinforcement learning-based self-play approach is proposed to achieve efficient RU-DU resource management, with AlphaGo Zero inspired neural Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Experiments on representative 2D bin packing environment and real sites data show that the self-play learning strategy achieves intelligent RU-DU resource assignment for different network conditions.
2019-07-01	Location Anomalies Detection for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles	arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.00811			paper-title-number-5	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00811.pdf		Future Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and more generally ITS, will form a highly interconnected system. Such a paradigm is referred to as the Internet of Vehicles (herein Internet of CAVs) and is a prerequisite to orchestrate traffic flows in cities. For optimal decision making and supervision, traffic centres will have access to suitably anonymized CAV mobility information. Safe and secure operations will then be contingent on early detection of anomalies. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning model based on deep autoencoder is proposed to detect the self-reported location anomaly in CAVs, using vehicle locations and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as features. Quantitative experiments on simulation datasets show that the proposed approach is effective and robust in detecting self-reported location anomalies.
2017-08-01	Infrared Dim and Small Target Detection Based on Stable Multisubspace Learning in Heterogeneous Scene	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing			paper-title-number-1	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/SMSL_paper.pdf       	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/SMSL_Wang.zip	Infrared (IR) dim and small target detection in a highly complex background play an important role in many applications, and remain a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel method named stable multisubspace learning is presented to deal with this problem. The new method takes into account the inner structure of actual images so that it overcomes the shortage of the traditional method. First, by analyzing the multisubspace structure of heterogeneous background data, a corresponding image model is proposed using subspace learning strategy. This model is also stable to noise interference. Second, an efficient optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed IR image model. By adding the proper postprocessing procedure, we can get the detection result. Experiments on simulation scenes and real scenes show that the proposed method has superior detection ability under heterogeneous background.
2017-07-01	Infrared dim target detection based on total variation regularization and principal component pursuit	Image and Vision Computing			paper-title-number-2	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/TV_PCP_paper.pdf       	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/TV-PCP_Wang.zip	Robust detection of infrared dim and small target contributes significantly to the infrared systems in many applications. Due to the diversity of background scene and unique characteristic of target, the detection of infrared targets remains a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel approach based on total variation regularization and principal component pursuit (TV-PCP) is presented to deal with this problem. The principal component pursuit model only considers the low-rank feature of background images, which will result in poor detection ability in non-uniform and non-smooth scenes. We take into account the total variation regularization term to thoroughly describe background feature, which can achieve good detection result as well as good background estimation result. Firstly, the input infrared image is transformed to a patch image model. Secondly, the TV-PCP model is presented on the patch image. An effective optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this model. Experiments on six real datasets show that the proposed method has superior detection ability under various backgrounds, especially with good background suppression performance and low false alarm rate.
2017-10-01	Infrared Small Target Detection via Nonnegativity-Constrained Variational Mode Decomposition	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters			paper-title-number-3	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/NVMD_paper.pdf       	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/NVMD_Wang.zip	Infrared small target detection is one of the key techniques in the infrared search and track system. Frequency differences among target, background, and noise are often important information for target detection. In this letter, a nonnegativity-constrained variational mode decomposition (NVMD) method is proposed. Unlike the traditional frequency-domain methods, the proposed method can adaptively decompose the input signal into several separated band-limited subsignals, with the nonnegativity constraint. First, a bandpass filter is used as a preprocessing step. Second, by exploring the frequency and nonnegativity properties of the small target, the NVMD model is constructed. The potential target subsignal can be obtained by solving the NVMD model. By performing threshold segmentation on the potential target subsignal, we can obtain the detection result of the infrared small target. Experiments on six real infrared image sequences demonstrate that the proposed method has a good performance in target enhancement and background suppression. Additionally, the proposed method shows strong robustness under various backgrounds.
2015-09-01	Infrared small dim target detection based on local contrast combined with region saliency (in Chinese)	High Power Laser and Particle Beams			paper-title-number-4	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/PLCM_paper.pdf       	http://Wang-Xiaoyang.github.io/files/PLCM_Wang.zip       	A part local contrast measure algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of low efficiency of the original local contrast measure, which combines region saliency with original local contrast measure. Instead of finding the target in the whole image, the local contrast measure is constrained in the saliency region of the current image frame in the proposed method. At the first stage, the image entropy and local similarity feature are used to evaluate the saliency of infrared images, which measures the saliency region of a single frame. At the second stage, the local contrast measure is presented in the saliency region, which forms the part local contrast map. An adaptive threshold is adapted to segment the target from the part local contrast map. Experiments on several real infrared image sequences have validated the ability of the proposed method in improving the signal-to-noise ratio and the detection capability. In particular, the proposed method can reduce false alarm rate, which is an inherent defect of the original local contrast method. The high efficiency is also an important strength of the proposed method, which leads to a wide application prospect.
